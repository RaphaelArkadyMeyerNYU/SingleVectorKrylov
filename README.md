## Single Vector Krylov

This is the public code repository for _On the Unreasonable Effectiveness of Single Vector Krylov Methods for Low-Rank Approximation_, a paper by [Raphael Meyer](https://ram900.hosting.nyu.edu/), [Cameron Musco](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~cmusco/), and [Christopher Musco](http://chrismusco.com/).

This repo contains Julia code to recreate the paper's experiments, as well as the exact experimental data that generated our plots and the Latex code to generate our exact figures.

## Julia Code

All of the code is in `single_vec_krylov.jl`, which was made to be browsed with [Julia for Visual Studio Code](https://www.julia-vscode.org/). The code will work perfectly fine in other IDEs, but the demarkation between different blocks of code are made for VS Code. The file is well commented, so hopefully everything you need to know is already in that file.

The code does assume that `nd3k_SVD.mat`, `human_gene2_SVD.mat`, `appu_SVD.mat`, and `exdata_1_SVD.mat` are all stored locally, in the same directory as `single_vec_krylov.jl`.
So if you want to recreate the grid of plots in Figures 1 and 6, be sure to have those files downloaded. You can find the files by searching for `nd3k`, `human_gene_2`, `appu`, and `exdata_1` on this [webpage](http://sparse.tamu.edu/) and downloading the "MATLAB" file under "SVD Statistics".

## Latex Code

We include a folder called `exports` full of CSVs that contain the exact data we use in the paper. These will be effectively generated by `single_vec_krylov.jl`, but we did not save the random seed for running these experiments, so we include our data for completeness. We also include the latex used to create our figures. `plot_headers.tex` is a short headers file to make sure the images use the same `pgfplots` version and use the same colors. Then, `plot_fig_X.tex` is the code used to generate Figure X in the paper, where $X \in \{1,3,4,5,6,7\}$.
